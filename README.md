G4SNVHunter is an R package leveraging the G4Hunter algorithm to systematically 
identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs), including single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), with the potential to destabilize G-quadruplex (G4) 
structures.

# Installation

You can install directly from GitHub using:

devtools::install_github("rongxinzh/G4SNVHunter")
```

Please note that if your operating system is Windows, you will need to install 
[Rtools](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html#Installing_RTools) on your 
system first.

# Quick Start
